   To have a line break without a paragraph, you must use two trailing spaces.
   Notice that this line is separated, but within the same paragraph.
   (This is contrary to typical GFM line break behavior, where no spaces are required.

## Links

[I am an inline link](https://www.google.com)

[I am an inline link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

I am a relative link to a [repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE.md)

You can use numbers for reference link definitions][1].

Or leave it blank and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets are automatically converted to links.
<http://www.example.com> or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes also
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

## Images

![More cats](cat.jpg 'Logo Title Text 1')

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| tables                    |  are  | cool |
| ------------------------- | :---: | ---: |
| column 3 is right-aligned | $1600 |

## blockquote

> Blockquotes are very handy in emails to display reply texts.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted correctly if it is wrapped. Oh boy, let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to wrap for everyone. Oh, you can put **markdown** in a blockquote.

## Footnotes

Footnotes are best placed immediately after the first paragraph used.[^footnote].

[^footnote]: However, you can also place them at the end of the document.

If you want to use endnotes, turn them on in the document options instead.

## Comments

<!-- Comments will not be displayed in the final PDF. -->

## Add citations to your document

Citations are enclosed in square brackets and separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key consisting of '@' + the citation identifier from the database, and can optionally have a prefix, a locator and a suffix. Here are some examples:

Blah blah [see @jones2016, pp. 33-35; also @sahle2015, ch. 1].

Blah blah [@jones2016, pp. 33-35, 38-39, and *passim*].

Blah blah [@sahle2015; @jones2016].

A minus sign (-) before the @ suppresses mention of the author in the citation. This can be useful if the author is already mentioned in the text:

Smith says blah [-@sahle2015].

You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

```markdown
@sahle2015 says blah.

@sahle2015 [p. 33] says blah.
```

However, this only works with citation styles like APA or Chicago.

## Change citation style

Select a style from the [CSL Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles) list or the corresponding [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) and change the `bibliography` line.
