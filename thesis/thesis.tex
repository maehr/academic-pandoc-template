Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people. Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law. Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations.

\chapter*{Zusammenfassung}
\begin{spacing}{1.5}
Die Anerkennung der angeborenen Würde und der gleichen und unveräußerlichen Rechte aller Mitglieder der Menschheitsfamilie ist die Grundlage für Freiheit, Gerechtigkeit und Frieden in der Welt. Die Missachtung und Verachtung der Menschenrechte hat zu barbarischen Taten geführt, die das Gewissen der Menschheit erzürnt haben, und das Streben nach einer Welt, in der die Menschen Rede- und Glaubensfreiheit sowie Freiheit von Furcht und Not genießen, wurde als höchstes Ziel des einfachen Volkes verkündet. Damit der Mensch nicht gezwungen ist, sich als letztes Mittel gegen Tyrannei und Unterdrückung aufzulehnen, ist es unerlässlich, dass die Menschenrechte durch die Rechtsstaatlichkeit geschützt werden. Es ist wichtig, die Entwicklung freundschaftlicher Beziehungen zwischen den Nationen zu fördern. Die Völker der Vereinten Nationen haben in der Charta ihren Glauben an die grundlegenden Menschenrechte, an die Würde und den Wert der menschlichen Person und an die Gleichberechtigung von Männern und Frauen bekräftigt und sind entschlossen, den sozialen Fortschritt und einen besseren Lebensstandard in größerer Freiheit zu fördern. Die Mitgliedstaaten haben sich verpflichtet, in Zusammenarbeit mit den Vereinten Nationen die weltweite Achtung und Einhaltung der Menschenrechte und Grundfreiheiten zu fördern. Ein gemeinsames Verständnis dieser Rechte und Freiheiten ist für die vollständige Verwirklichung dieses Versprechens von größter Bedeutung. Die Generalversammlung verkündet daher diese Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte als gemeinsamen Maßstab für alle Völker und Nationen, damit jeder Einzelne und jedes Organ der Gesellschaft, die sich diese Erklärung ständig vor Augen halten, sich bemühen, durch Unterricht und Erziehung die Achtung vor diesen Rechten und Freiheiten zu fördern und durch fortschreitende Maßnahmen auf nationaler und internationaler Ebene ihre allgemeine und wirksame Anerkennung und Einhaltung sowohl unter den Völkern der Mitgliedstaaten selbst als auch unter den Völkern der ihrer Hoheitsgewalt unterstehenden Gebiete sicherzustellen.

\chapter{Acknowledgment}\label{sec:acknowledgment}}

Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation
of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in
barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the
advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech
and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the
highest aspiration of the common people,

Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse,
as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that
human rights should be protected by the rule of law,

Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations
between nations,

Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed
their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the
human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have
determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in
larger freedom,

Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in
co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect
for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the
greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,

Now, therefore,

The General Assembly

Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common
standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that
every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration
constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote
respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures,
national and international, to secure their universal and effective
recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States
themselves and among the peoples of territories under their
jurisdiction.
